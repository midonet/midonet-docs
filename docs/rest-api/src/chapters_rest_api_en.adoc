[[introduction]]
== Introduction

This document specifies a RESTful API for creating and managing MidoNet
resources. The API uses JSON as its format.


[[getting-started]]
== Getting Started

This section is intended to help users get started on using the API. It
assumes that the MidoNet Management REST API host is known. This host is
represented as `example.org` in this document. The following GET request
to the base URL of the API reveals the locations of the available
resources :

-------------------------------------------------------
GET /
Host: example.org
Accept: application/vnd.org.midonet.Application-v5+json
-------------------------------------------------------

The request above may yield the following output :

---------------------------------------------------------------
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/vnd.org.midonet.Application-v5+json

---------------------------------------------------------------

This reveals that users can access the router resources using the URI
`/routers`. Host resources are accessible with the URI `/hosts`. The
response also includes information about the API version. The URIs with
`\{id}` in them are _uri-templates_, and they are explained later in this
document.


[[common-behaviors]]
== Common Behaviors

This section specifies the common constraints that apply to all the
requests and responses that occur in the MidoNet Management REST API.


[[media-types]]
=== Media Types

In MidoNet REST API, the resources are encoded in JSON, as specified in
RFC 4267. Each type of resource has its own media-type, which matches
the pattern:

_application/vnd.org.midonet.xxxxx-v#+json_

where _xxxxx_ represents the unique resource identifier and _#_ is the
media type's version number. For most media types the version number
will be 1, but several media types have additional versions. See the
sections on individual media types for available versions. Starting with
MidoNet v5.0, the REST API discontinued support for old media type versions,
and in general you must use the newest available version.

When doing a _GET_ on a particular resource, specify the media type in the
`Accept` header field. When doing a _POST_ or _PUT_ on a particular resource,
specify the media type in the `Content-Type` header field. This also
applies when you are operating on collections as well.


[[request-headers]]
=== Request Headers

The following HTTP request headers are relevant to MidoNet REST API:

[width="100%",cols="15%,34%,36%,15%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Header |Supported Values |Description |Required
|Accept |Comma-delimited list of media types or media type patterns
|Indicates to the server what media type(s) this client is prepared to
accept |No, but recommended

|Content Type |Media type describing the request message body |Describes
the representation and syntax of the request message body |Yes
|=======================================================================


[[response-headers]]
=== Response Headers

The following HTTP response headers exist in MidoNet REST API:

[width="100%",cols="14%,27%,32%,27%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Header |Supported Values |Description |Required
|Content Type |Media type describing the response message body
|Describes the representation and syntax of the response message body
|Yes

|Location |Canonical URI of a newly created resource |A new URI that can
be used to request a representation of the newly created resource |Yes,
on responsed that create new server side resources which are accessible via
a URI
|=======================================================================


[[http-status-codes]]
=== HTTP Status Codes

The following HTTP status codes are returned from MidoNet REST API:

[width="100%",cols="33%,67%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|HTTP Status |Description
|200 OK |The request was successfully completed, and the response body
contains the resource data.

|201 Created |A new resource was successfully created. A Location header
contains the URI of the resource.

|204 No Content |The server fulfilled the request, but does not need to
return anything.

|400 Bad Request |The request could not be processed because it
contained missing or invalid information.

|401 Unauthorized |The authentication credentials included with the
request are missing or invalid.

|403 Forbidden |The server recognized the credentials, but the user is
not authorized to perform this request.

|404 Not Found |The requested URI does not exist.

|405 Method Not Allowed |The HTTP verb specified in the request (GET,
POST, PUT, DELETE, HEAD) is not supported for this URI.

|406 Not Acceptable |The resource identified by this request is not
capable of generating a representation corresponding to one of the media
types in the Accept header.

|409 Conflict |A creation or update request could not be completed
because it would cause a conflict in the current state of the resources.
One example is when a request attempts to create a resource with an identifier
that already exists.

|500 Internal Server Error |The server encountered an unexpected
condition which prevented the request to be completed.

|503 Service Unavailable |The server is currently unable to handle the
request due to temporary overloading or maintenance of the server.
|=======================================================================


[[uri-templates]]
=== URI Templates

A URI may contain a part that is left out to the client to fill. These
parts are enclosed inside `{` and `}`.

For example, given a URI template, `http://example.org/routers/{id}` and
a router identifier `d7435bb0-3bc8-11e2-81c1-0800200c9a66`, after doing the
replacement, the final URI becomes:
`http://example.org/routers/d7435bb0-3bc8-11e2-81c1-0800200c9a66`.

The following table lists the existing expressions in the URI templates
and what they should be replaced with:

[width="56%",cols="27%,73%",options="header",]
|=================================
|Expression |Replace with
|id |Unique identifier of resource
|ipAddr |IP address
|macAddress |MAC address
|portId |Port UUID
|portName |Port name
|vlanId |VLAN identifier
|=================================


[[methods]]
=== Methods

[[post]]
==== POST

Used to create a new resource. The `Location` header field in the
response contains the URI of the newly created resource.

[[put]]
==== PUT

Used to update an existing resource.

[[get]]
==== GET

Used to retrieve one more more resources. It could either return a
single object or a collection of objects in the response.

[[delete]]
==== DELETE

In MidoNet API, the _DELETE_ operation means cascade delete unless noted
otherwise. When a resource is deleted, all of its child resources are
also deleted.


[[resource-models]]
== Resource Models

This section specifies the representations of the MidoNet REST API
resources. Each type of resource has its own Internet Media Type. The
media type for each resource is included in square brackets in the
corresponding section header.

The 'POST/PUT' column indicates whether the field can be included in the
request with these verbs. If they are not specified, the field should
not be included in the request.

The Required column indicates is only relevant for POST/PUT operations.
You should not see any entry for 'Required' if the 'POST/PUT' column is
empty. When the Required value is set, it will have indicate whether the
field is relevant for POST, PUT or both. Required fields need to be
included in the request to create/update the object. Note that fields
may be required for PUT but not POST, and viceversa. In this case it
will be indicated in the specific cell for the field.


[[application]]
=== Application

[[condition-dl-address-masking-works]]
==== Data Link Layer Address Masking

The data link address masking helps to reduce the number of L2 address match
conditions.

For example, if you specify `dlDstMask` to be `ffff.0000.0000`, and if
`dlDst` is `abcd.0000.0000`, all traffic with the destination MAC address
that starts with `abcd` will be matched, regardless of the value of the
least significant 32 bits.

[[condition-tp-port-range]]
==== Transport Layer Port Range

The port range is a JSON object defining the boundaries of the port number
interval to match. The `start` boundary must be smaller than the `end`
boundary.

---------------------------
{ "start": 80, "end": 400 }
---------------------------

The range may be open-ended where, one of the range boundaries but not both
may be missing.

[width="100%",cols="23%,10%,11%,11%,45%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Field Name |Type |POST/PUT |Required |Description
|uri |URI | |
|A GET against this URI refreshes the representation of this resource.

|device |URI | |
|A GET against this URI retrieves the device resource to which this port
belongs. If the port is a bridge port, it returns a bridge resource. If it is
a router port, it returns a router resource.

|host |URI | |
|A GET against this URI returns the host where the port is bound. The request
succeeds only if the port is an exterior port, bound to a host.

|hostInterfacePort |URI | |
|A GET against this URI returns the interface-binding information for this port.

|inboundFilter |URI | |
|A GET against this URI returns the inbound filter chain.

|link |URI | |
|A POST against this URI links two interior ports. A DELETE against this URI
removes the link. The body of the request must contain a link resource. See
xref:port-link[].

|outboundFilter |URI | |
|A GET against this URI returns the outbound filter chain.

|peer |URI | |
|A GET against this URI returns the peer port. It requires a port to be
linked to another port.

|portGroups |URI | |
|A GET against this URI returns the port groups of which this port is a
member.

|id |UUID |POST |No
|A unique identifier of the resource. If this field is omitted in the POST
request, a random UUID is generated.

|type |String |POST |Yes
|Type of port. It must be one of the following:

* `Bridge`
* `Router`

A new router or bridge port is unplugged. Depending on what it is later attached
to, it is referred to as an _exterior_ or _interior_ port.

An exterior router port is a virtual port that plugs into the VIF of an entity,
such as a VM. It can also be a virtual port connected to a host physical port,
directly or after implementing tunnel encapsulation. Access to exterior ports is
managed by OpenVSwitch (OpenFlow switch). Exterior bridge port is the same as
exterior router port but it is a port on a virtual bridge. Upon being bound to
an interface, the port becomes exterior and will have the `hostId`, `host`, and
`interfaceName` fields be non-null. The `peer` and `peerId` fields will be null.

An interior router port is a virtual port that only exists in the MidoNet
virtual router network abstraction. It refers to a logical connection to another
virtual networking device such as another router. An interior bridge port is the
equivalent on a virtual bridge. Upon being linked to a peer, a port will become
interior and will have the `peer` and `peerId` fields be non-null. The `hostId`,
`host`, and `interfaceName` fields will be null.

There is a third type of port, `Vxlan`, which is created automatically when
binding a VTEP to a Neutron network. The only operations supported on a port of
this type are GET.

|adminStateUp |Boolean |POST/PUT |No
|The administrative state of the port. If _false_ (down), the port stops
forwarding packets. If it is a router port, it additionally replies with a
_Communication administratively prohibited_ ICMP response. The default is
_true_ (up).

|inboundFilterId |UUID |POST/PUT |No
|The identifier of the filter chain to be applied for ingress packets.

|inboundMirrorIds |Array of UUID |POST/PUT |No
|The list of identifiers for the port mirrors to be applied for ingress packets.

|insertionIds |Array of UUID |POST/PUT |No
|The list of identifiers for the service insertions to be applied to this port.

|outboundFilterId |UUID |POST/PUT |No
|The identifier of the filter chain to be applied for egress packets.

|outboundMirrorIds |Array of UUID |POST/PUT |No
|The list of identifiers for the port mirrors to be applied for egress packets.

|deviceId |UUID | |
|The identifier of the device (bridge or router) to which this port belongs.

|interfaceName |String | |
|The interface name for a bound port. This will be set when binding a port to a
host, becoming an exterior port. See
xref:host-interface-port[].

|hostId |UUID | |No
|The identifier of the host where this port is bound. This will be set when
binding a port to a host, becoming an exterior port.

|peerId |UUID | |
|The identifier of the peer port to which this port is linked. This will be set
when linking a port to another peer, becoming an interior port. See

[[resource-collection]]
== Resource Collection

A collection of a resource is represented by inserting 'collection'
right before the resource name in the media type. For example, to get a
collection of Tenants V1 you would represent:

`vnd.org.midonet.Tenant-v1+json`

as:

`vnd.org.midonet.collection.Tenant-v1+json`

See the Query Parameters section of each resource type whether the
collection can be filtered.


[[bulk-creation]]
== Bulk Creation

The following resources support bulk creation where multiple objects can
be created atomically:

* Neutron Network
* Neutron Subnet
* Neutron Port

The URI for the bulk creation is the same as one used to do single
object creation. It also expects POST method. The only difference is
that the Content-Type must be set to the Collection Media Type specified
in each of the resource section above. These special media types
indicate to the API server that multiple resource objects are being
submitted in the request body.


[[authentication-authorization]]
== Authentication/Authorization

MidoNet API provides two ways to authenticate: username/password and
token. MidoNet uses Basic Access Authentication
footnote:[http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2617] scheme for
username/password authentication. From the client with username 'foo'
and password 'bar', the following HTTP POST request should be sent to
'/login' path appended to the base URI:

---------------------------------
POST    /login
Authorization: Basic Zm9vOmJhcg==
---------------------------------

where `Zm9vOmJhcg==` is the base64 encoded value of `foo:bar`.

If the API sever is configured to use OpenStack Keystone as its
authentication service, then the tenant name given in the web.xml file
will be used in the request sent to the keystone authentication service.
However, you can override this tenant name by specifying it in the
request header. :

-----------------------------------
X-Auth-Project: example_tenant_name
-----------------------------------

The server returns 401 Unauthorized if the authentication fails, and 200
if succeeds. When the login succeeds, the server sets 'Set-Cookie'
header with the generated token and its expiration data as such:

----------------------------------------------------------------
Set-Cookie: sessionId=baz; Expires=Fri, 02 July 2014 1:00:00 GMT
----------------------------------------------------------------

where 'baz' is the token and 'Wed, 09 Jun 2021 10:18:14 GM' is the
expiration date. The token can be used for all the subsequent requests
until it expires. Additionally, the content type is set to a Token json
type as such:

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Content-Type: application/vnd.org.midonet.Token-v1+json;charset=UTF-8
---------------------------------------------------------------------

with the body of the response set to the token information:

-------------------------------------------------------
{"key":"baz","expires":"Fri, 02 July 2014 1:00:00 GMT"}
-------------------------------------------------------

To send a token instead for authentication, the client needs to set it
in `X-Auth-Token` HTTP header:

-----------------
X-Auth-Token: baz
-----------------

The server returns 200 if the token is validated successfully, 401 if
the token was invalid, and 500 if there was a server error.

For authorization, if the requesting user attempts to perform operations
or access resources that it does not have permission to, the API returns
403 Forbidden in the response. Currently there are only three roles in
MidoNet:

* Admin: Superuser that has access to everything
* Tenant Admin: Admin of a tenant that has access to everything that
belongs to the tenant
* Tenant User: User of a tenant that only has read-only access to
resources belonging to the tenant

Roles and credentials are set up in the auth service used by the API.
